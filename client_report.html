        <h2>Client Report</h2>
        <p>
          I decided what content and images to use for my site plan based on my interests and personal style. I wanted something creative, peaceful, and a little playful, so I chose nature and space elements with a custom cat logo. I used soft colors and fun fonts to match that vibe.
        </p>
        <p>
          I communicated with my developer through in-class discussions and emails. There were no major communication issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          My developer did meet my expectations. The layout, colors, and style turned out well and fit the plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next time, I will try to give feedback earlier and communicate more clearly about small visual details.

        <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
        <p>
          I managed my development team by assigning one junior developer to work on the "Data Center" page and the other on the "Contact" page. We communicated mainly through in-class discussions and email to make sure everyone understood their tasks and stayed on the same page.
        </p>
        <p>
          I communicated with the client through emails and in-class discussions. There were no major communication issues. I communicated with the client to confirm colors, layout, and design style. Everything went smoothly and on schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          I published the site using GitHub Pages and shared the link with the client for feedback and approval.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, I wasn't very familiar with using GitHub, so I had some trouble understanding how to push changes and manage the repository. But after some practice and help from my classmates, I learned how to use it properly. By the end of the project, I felt more confident using GitHub for version control and collaboration. GitHub was helpful for version control and collaboration. I committed regularly and solved small issues during the process.

        <h2>Junior Developer Report - Site: Massey</h2>
        <p>
          I communicated with my lead developer, Esmeralda E Sanchez, through emails and in-class discussions. She gave clear instructions, and I followed them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, I knew my responsibilities. I worked on child page 2(Book free cruise) and followed the site plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was able to contribute successfully. My lead developer supported me and the work was divided fairly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had some GitHub errors when pushing changes, but I got help and learned to fix them.

        <h2>Junior Developer Report - Site: Legaspi</h2>
        <p>
          My lead developer for this site, Kelson Layton, did not contact me. I tried to reach out, but didn’t get a response.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of that, I didn’t know what page to work on. I told Brother Alvey in class, and he said I didn’t need to work on that page anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did not contribute to that site, but I was ready to if I had heard from the team.
        </p>

          <strong>Site Link:</strong> Not available (I was not assigned due to team issue).

        <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
        <p>
          The most challenging part was fixing some GitHub errors. It was frustrating at first, but with help I figured it out and now feel more confident.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoyed designing the layout and seeing everything come together. It felt great to make a real site.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I could do it again, I would ask more questions earlier and try to plan my tasks better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, I feel more confident working on real-world projects. I learned how to communicate in a team, organize tasks, and use tools like GitHub and CSS for professional sites.
